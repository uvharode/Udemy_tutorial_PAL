             <p>The Hotel des Balances is steeped in history that reaches back to 1199. More than 100 years ago the nobility met for tea in the art nouveau lounges. Princess Luise of Baden and the Dutch queen Wilhelmine honoured the establishment with their presence. Celebrities from across Europe, such as the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, also stayed here on their visits to Central Switzerland. In the 1960s the well-known cabaret artist Emil Steinberger began his stage career at the Hotel des Balances.</p> </div>
